# Eikon miner â€” Building survivorship bias-free S&P 500

Survivorship bias also rears its ugly head in finance and business. Because of the nature of data, it's easier to find records of things that exist than no longer exist. You need to be carefull and watch out for situations where survivorship bias skews the data. In [this](https://github.com/dsantamaria-sudo/eikon_miner/blob/main/Eikon_miner.py) code we show you how to create your own survivorship bias-free S&P 500 using Python and API connection to Thomson Reuters Eikon app.

# Steps to follow

In summary the steps followed in the [code](https://github.com/dsantamaria-sudo/eikon_miner/blob/main/Eikon_miner.py) are:

1. Download SP&500 daily historical OHLC data.
2. Download daily S&P500 constituents.
3. List with unique rics in the whole period.
4. Download historical OHLC data for SP&500 constituents.
5. OHLC data day by day.
6. BONUS
